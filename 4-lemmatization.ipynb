      "she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\r\n",
      "looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\r\n",
      "cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\r\n",

      "Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! âI wonder how\r\n",
      "many miles Iâve fallen by this time?â she said aloud. âI must be getting\r\n",
      "somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four\r\n",
      "thousand miles down, I think--â (for, you see, Alice had learnt several\r\n",
      "things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this\r\n",

      "bats eat cats?â for, you see, as she couldnât answer either question,\r\n",
      "it didnât much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing\r\n",

      "away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in\r\n",
      "the pool as it went.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\r\n",
      "rabbits. I almost wish I hadnât gone down that rabbit-hole--and yet--and\r\n",
      "yet--itâs rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\r\n",
      "CAN have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âBut then,â thought Alice, âshall I NEVER get any older than I am\r\n",
      "now? Thatâll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but\r\n",
      "then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldnât like THAT!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\r\n",
      "but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\r\n",
      "from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\r\n",
      "cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "all!â âDo as I tell you, you coward!â and at last she spread out her\r\n",

      "TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. âWhat a number of\r\n",

      "rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices\r\n",
      "all talking together: she made out the words: âWhereâs the other\r\n",
      "ladder?--Why, I hadnât to bring but one; Billâs got the other--Bill!\r\n",
      "fetch it here, lad!--Here, put âem up at this corner--No, tie âem\r\n",
      "together first--they donât reach half high enough yet--Oh! theyâll\r\n",
      "do well enough; donât be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of this\r\n",
      "rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, itâs coming\r\n",
      "down! Heads below!â (a loud crash)--âNow, who did that?--It was Bill, I\r\n",
      "fancy--Whoâs to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shanât! YOU do it!--That I\r\n",
      "wonât, then!--Billâs to go down--Here, Bill! the master says youâre to\r\n",

      "Billâs place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\r\n",
      "I THINK I can kick a little!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The first thing she heard was a general chorus of âThere goes Bill!â\r\n",
      "then the Rabbitâs voice along--âCatch him, you by the hedge!â then\r\n",
      "silence, and then another confusion of voices--âHold up his head--Brandy\r\n",
      "now--Donât choke him--How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell\r\n",
      "us all about it!â\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "out as loud as she could, âIf you do. Iâll set Dinah at you!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, âI\r\n",
      "wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any sense, theyâd take the\r\n",
      "roof off.â After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\r\n",
      "Alice heard the Rabbit say, âA barrowful will do, to begin with.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âA barrowful of WHAT?â thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\r\n",
      "for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\r\n",
      "window, and some of them hit her in the face. âIâll put a stop to this,â\r\n",
      "she said to herself, and shouted out, âYouâd better not do that again!â\r\n",
      "which produced another dead silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\r\n",
      "little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\r\n",
      "head. âIf I eat one of these cakes,â she thought, âitâs sure to make\r\n",
      "SOME change in my size; and as it canât possibly make me larger, it must\r\n",
      "make me smaller, I suppose.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\r\n",
      "began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through\r\n",
      "the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little\r\n",
      "animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was\r\n",
      "in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\r\n",
      "something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\r\n",
      "appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\r\n",
      "safe in a thick wood.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe first thing Iâve got to do,â said Alice to herself, as she wandered\r\n",
      "about in the wood, âis to grow to my right size again; and the second\r\n",
      "thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be\r\n",
      "the best plan.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\r\n",
      "arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\r\n",
      "how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\r\n",
      "the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\r\n",
      "great hurry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\r\n",
      "feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. âPoor little thing!â\r\n",
      "said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but\r\n",
      "she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be\r\n",
      "hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of\r\n",
      "all her coaxing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\r\n",
      "held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\r\n",
      "all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\r\n",
      "and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\r\n",
      "to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\r\n",
      "other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\r\n",
      "over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\r\n",
      "very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\r\n",
      "moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\r\n",
      "the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\r\n",
      "little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\r\n",
      "all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\r\n",
      "its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\r\n",
      "set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and\r\n",
      "till the puppyâs bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd yet what a dear little puppy it was!â said Alice, as she leant\r\n",
      "against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\r\n",
      "leaves: âI should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if Iâd\r\n",
      "only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! Iâd nearly forgotten that\r\n",
      "Iâve got to grow up again! Let me see--how IS it to be managed? I\r\n",

      "question is, what?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at\r\n",
      "the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\r\n",
      "looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\r\n",
      "There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\r\n",
      "herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\r\n",
      "behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\r\n",
      "was on the top of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\r\n",
      "mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,\r\n",
      "that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long\r\n",

      "âIâm afraid I canât put it more clearly,â Alice replied very politely,\r\n",
      "âfor I canât understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\r\n",
      "different sizes in a day is very confusing.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt isnât,â said the Caterpillar.\r\n",

      "after that into a butterfly, I should think youâll feel it a little\r\n",
      "queer, wonât you?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNot a bit,â said the Caterpillar.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "âWhy?â said the Caterpillar.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\r\n",
      "good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant\r\n",
      "state of mind, she turned away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and\r\n",
      "every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she\r\n",

      "size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that\r\n",

      "wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\r\n",
      "otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\r\n",

      "invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.â\r\n",

      "Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\r\n",

      "wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\r\n",

      "âThereâs no sort of use in knocking,â said the Footman, âand that for\r\n",
      "two reasons. First, because Iâm on the same side of the door as you\r\n",
      "are; secondly, because theyâre making such a noise inside, no one could\r\n",
      "possibly hear you.â And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise\r\n",
      "going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then\r\n",
      "a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.\r\n",

      "He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this\r\n",
      "Alice thought decidedly uncivil. âBut perhaps he canât help it,â she\r\n",
      "said to herself; âhis eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head.\r\n",

      "     Like a tea-tray in the sky.\r\n",

      "Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself\r\n",
      "to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\r\n",
      "repeated her question. âWhy did they live at the bottom of a well?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âThereâs no such thing!â Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âNo, please go on!â Alice said very humbly; âI wonât interrupt again. I\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âOne, indeed!â said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\r\n",

      "He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\r\n",
      "moved into the Dormouseâs place, and Alice rather unwillingly took\r\n",
      "the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\r\n",
      "advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\r\n",
      "before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "from?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou can draw water out of a water-well,â said the Hatter; âso I should\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âThey were learning to draw,â the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\r\n",
      "its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; âand they drew all manner of\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âWhy with an M?â said Alice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into\r\n",
      "a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with\r\n",
      "a little shriek, and went on: â--that begins with an M, such as\r\n",
      "mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say\r\n",

      "âThen you shouldnât talk,â said the Hatter.\r\n",

      "neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\r\n",
      "looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\r\n",
